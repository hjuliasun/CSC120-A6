- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Starting this homework was a little difficult. I was struggling especially with the syntax and understanding how each method would interact with each other. I wouldn't say that this new concept was different or harder to grasp compared to previous concepts.

Because I was gone on medical leave, I had catch up with weeks of material in order to do this homework. Hence, the reason for me turning this in late. But what I found really helpful was doing the homework at TA hours. Allison really helped me understand key concepts of `Inheritance`.
